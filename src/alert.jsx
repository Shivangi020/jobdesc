        If an employer asks you to pay any security deposit, registration fee, laptop fee, 
        etc.,
        <strong>do not </strong> pay and <strong><u> notify us </u></strong> 
        immediately. Remember, Internshala  <strong> doesn't charge</strong> a fee from the students to apply to a job or an internship & 
        <strong> we don't </strong> 
        allow other companies to do so either.</p>
